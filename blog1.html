        Constance Payne – All fur intact Corgi, 4, seeks loveable, mature
        playmate (but not over 7) for a lasting platonic puppy relationship.
        Despite her being a special three-legged damsel, she is the delight of
        all village creatures, alive and dead. What a catch!

        Gregor – This suave pup is a hit at the Zumba club. Being the unique
        breed that he is, the Bavarian Borscht Sniffer, he can detect the aroma
        of the mighty red soup cooking anywhere on the planet. Better get a long
        leash for Gregor…

        “Brak! Brak! Brak!” barks Alex, our dyslexic dachshund. Last week it was
        2 braks and 1 bark so it got our hopes up for Alex’s recovery but now
        he’s back to all braks again. CARP!

        JEREMIAH WAS A BULLFROG NOT A SPANISH TERRIER BUT THAT’S WHAT WE NAMED
        HIM ANYWAY. Name-abused dog files suit against Lester and Arlette Grit,
        world renown butter magnates, his parents, for having named him a
        grossly inappropriate name. Jeremiah claims that his name should have
        only been used for a bullfrog and not a Spanish Terrier! Jury selection
        starts Tuesday.

         We did! That’s why we partnered with NYRPF (NY Reptiles for Progress) to offer this 493-week bootcamp which will guarantee every scaley reptile north of  Westchester a new purpose in life.
        <br><br>
        This intensive Bootcamp will take place on a freshly drenched meadow beside Lake LostDaCode. Housing is provided at a ridiculous cost for trust fund lizards and such, but we recommend just camping out at the site. 
        <br><br>
        Upon arrival you will be greeted by Nada Foyou, Queen of the Left Bank Lizards, who will sprinkle code dust on you, mumble some words, and escort you to HTML House where you will pay for your course. Then we will eat.
        <br><br>
        Then for the next 493 weeks we will study Python, of course. We will learn how to customize the shedding of our skin and to strengthen our toe pads with Python, and much more.
