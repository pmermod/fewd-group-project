        Constance Payne – All fur intact Corgi, 4, seeks loveable, mature
        playmate (but not over 7) for a lasting platonic puppy relationship.
        Despite her being a special three-legged damsel, she is the delight of
        all village creatures, alive and dead. What a catch!

        Gregor – This suave pup is a hit at the Zumba club. Being the unique
        breed that he is, the Bavarian Borscht Sniffer, he can detect the aroma
        of the mighty red soup cooking anywhere on the planet. Better get a long
        leash for Gregor…

        Falls Annual Hairball Pageant! (Her 1st cousin’s a cat.) Come one, come
        all! Bring your own scoop!

        “Brak! Brak! Brak!” barks Alex, our dyslexic dachshund. Last week it was
        2 braks and 1 bark so it got our hopes up for Alex’s recovery but now
        he’s back to all braks again. CARP!

        JEREMIAH WAS A BULLFROG NOT A SPANISH TERRIER BUT THAT’S WHAT WE NAMED
        HIM ANYWAY. Name-abused dog files suit against Lester and Arlette Grit,
        world renown butter magnates, his parents, for having named him a
        grossly inappropriate name. Jeremiah claims that his name should have
        only been used for a bullfrog and not a Spanish Terrier! Jury selection
        starts Tuesday.
